      <h2>Description of a Triangle</h2>
        <p>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry.</p>
      <h3>Types of a triangle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Equilateral</li>
            <li>Isosceles</li>
            <li>Scalene</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Equilateral</h4>
        <img src="images/eqltrl.gif">
        <p>In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. and all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.</p>
      <h4>Isosceles</h4>
        <img src="images/isosceles.png">
        <p>In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.</p>
      <h4>Scalene</h4>
        <img src="images/scalene.jpg">
        <p>A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides, such as that one illustrated above.</p>

Isosceles Triangle which means the two sides are exactly equal. that is when you specify the lenght of each side in which two sides are equal, there will be an alert box that says that its an Isosceles Triangle. or Scalene Triangle which means the sum of two sides are greater than or equal to the thrid one. that is when you specify the three sides in which the sum of two sides are greater than the third side, there will be an alert box that says that its a Scalene Triangle. you can also chech if the triangle is definitely not a triangle by checking if the sum of two side are less than or equal to the third one.*
